# Jekyll Multiverse Template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joaomlneto/jekyll-multiverse-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joaomlneto/jekyll-multiverse-template)

This is a Jekyll site template based on the [Multiverse](https://html5up.net/multiverse) template by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net)

Each of the images displayed in the website is its own separate *post*:
- Metadata (image title and caption) goes in the [`_images`](_images) folder
- Actual images (thumbnails and fulls go into [`assets/images`](assets/images)).
